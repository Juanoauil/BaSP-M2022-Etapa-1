## Week 3 - CSS of Trackgenix Landing Page

This week we are going to add css to the landing page of Trackgenix for desktop. The main idea is that it remains the same as in Figma.

## Week 4 - CSS of Trackgenix with Flex

This week we'll learn the philosophy of 'Mobile First' and we'll use display flex. Based on the design that we have done in Figma, we have to develop the css of the landing page of Trackgenix again, starting with the size of a mobile, going through the size of a tablet, and ending with the size of a desktop.

## Week 6 - Login and SignUp responsive pages with Javascript

This week we'll be working on the employee screenflow that was made in the first week.
We have to create the html and css files that correspond to the login and the sign up. In case we have time, we'll also create the one of contact.
We have to join these files to the index file so we can browse between the different tabs.
For each of the new html files, we must generate a new js file that validates the data entry in the corresponding fields.
